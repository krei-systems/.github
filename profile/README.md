# Krei Systems 

👋️ Hello, there! We're a software company that's pushing the boundaries of what
can be solved through computational means and with the current advancements of
machines.

☯️️ You can find in this page open source software that we wrote and we use
ourselves in our build and development systems. We use primarily use
[Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org) and [Nix](https://nixos.org), and occasionally
[Clojure](https://clojure.org), [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) and Scheme.

❄️️ We use [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and
[NixOS](https://nixos.org) as our primary development systems and we deploy  on
macOS, GNU/Linux, and the web.

🌌 Our engineers love to talk about random things, and they can be found at
